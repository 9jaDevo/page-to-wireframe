# Page to wireframe

A chrome extension to take a live webpage and make it look like a wireframe.

![What a github page looks like wireframed](https://github.com/ao5357/page-to-wireframe/raw/master/icons/screenshot.png)

## Why

I make websites, and sometimes I want to make a site first, then demonstrate its micro-IA separately, without showing a 
huge level of detail or design fidelity.

This extension lets you click a button and have everything on the page appear low-fidelity. You can then 
take screenshots and perform other operations in order to export your wires.

## How

It's written to be as asynchronous, event-driven, and resource-light as possible.

## Development

If you'd like to fix bugs, add features, improve performance, or otherwise contribute to the project, 
I'm very open to pull requests.

### Install (unpacked)

To install the development version of the extension, either clone the repo or use the ZIP download. 
At chrome://extensions make sure to check the "Developer mode" checkbox in the upper right-hand corner. 
After that, there will be a button to load an unpacked extension. Click that and select the folder 
containing the extension. It should then be ready to go!

Thank you for your interest in Page to wireframe!
